      there are two types of routing 
      - server side routing 
        Every time you click a link, the browser sends a request to the server, and the server sends back a full new HTML page.
          In a traditional website:

            You click /about

            The browser sends a request to the server:
            GET /about

            The server sends a new HTML file â†’ page reloads


      - clinet side routing 
          When you click a link like /about, it doesn't reload the page.

          Instead, JavaScript updates the URL and shows the new component (like About page) instantly.
          Benefit:
          Faster navigation

          Better user experience (no full page refresh)
